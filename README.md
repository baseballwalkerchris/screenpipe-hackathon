Every app, website, and product is built for users—but how do you know if people can actually use them?
Bad user experiences lead to frustration, abandoned checkouts, and lost customers. Yet, traditional user testing is time-consuming and inefficient. Designers have to manually review hours of screen recordings, sift through scattered feedback, and try to figure out what went wrong. That’s why we built Sensus—a smarter, AI-powered way to understand how real users interact with your product. Powered by Screenpipe, Sensus analyzes user actions, identifies pain points, and generates AI-powered recommendations—all while keeping data secure on the user's device, thanks to Screenpipe's local-first technology.
